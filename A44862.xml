            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

For it contains the most excellent sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and that which lies nearest your Royal Heart, the Doctrin of the Catholic Church: and this so clearly deduced, and evinced, that I dare say, it shines no where brighter except in your Majesties Life and Example. Ecclesiastical Writers only draw the Lines, while the Lives of good Christians lay on the Colors: And tho' <hi>all the Glory of the Kings Daughter be from within,</hi> yet all the Beauty which charms the Eye, and renders the Church as Lovely, as she is Holy, is <hi>from without,</hi> in the Piety of her Children, especially of Queens; so

            <p>THO' this great in little Volume needs no other Recommendation than the bare Perusal, nor the Writer of it other Encomium than his bare Name to give credit to both; the Work it self ennobling the Author, and the Author the Work; yet to give each it's due weight, and let the Reader more clearly understand as well the Fruit by the Tree, as the Tree by the Fruit: Take here a short abstract first of the Authors Life, next of the Reasons or Motives of this present Publication. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first, please to know the Book was long since composed for the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Instruction of a private friend, by my Uncle Mr. <hi>Rich. Hudleston</hi> the Youngest Son of <hi>Andrew Hudleston</hi> of <hi>Farrington</hi> Hall in <hi>Lancashire.</hi> He was Born towards the end of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> when he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Years of Maturity for Studies, he was sent to <hi>Rhemes</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where he became an exquisit Proficient in Poetry and Rhetoric: from <hi>Rhemes</hi> he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he passed his Schools of Philosophy and Divinity with an improvement proportionable to his great Wit and Industry. These Studies compleated, That he might effectually advance as well in Piety as Learning, he entered into a Religious State, and was professed at famous <hi>Mont-Cassine,</hi> the first Monastery founded by the Holy Patriarc St. <hi>Benedict</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> In this Holy Place he spent divers Years in Solitude, Prayer, Reading the Scriptures, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which Theory having attained an Eminent degree of Perfection, at length, throughly qualified for an Apostolick Missioner he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>England.</hi> Here like another St. <hi>Augustin</hi> endued with an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Spirit he exerted his Talents in Preaching, Teaching, Disputing, and Reducing his strayed Country-men to the Sheep-fold of Christ: And it pleased the Divine Goodness to bless his endeavors, and second his Words with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary success. In all as well publick Debates, as private Conferences he still came off a Conqueror; insomuch that many chief Families as those of the <hi>Irelands, Watertons, Middletons, Traps</hi>'s, <hi>Thimbelbyes,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi> Those of the <hi>Prestons, Andertons, Downs</hi>'s, <hi>Straffords, Sherbourns, Ingelbyes.</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>Lancashire:</hi> With numberless others of all States and Conditions, owe next to God, their respective Reconciliations to this worthy <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictine.</hi> But I do not pretend here to frame a Panegyric, it may suffice in short to aver, That the Purity of his Life bore equal Measures with the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of his Doctrin; both unblemished: And that after Thirty Years of Faithful Labors in Christ's Vinyard, He rested in Peace, leaving behind him a Sweet Odor of Vertue to all Posterity. He Writ on several Occurences several Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises, of which one is this small but <hi>Fortunate</hi> Book we now Publ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>sh; <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40980:5"/> I say, in that (God so Ordaining) it became an occasional Instrument towards the Conversion of our late Sovereign Lord King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, to the Faith and Unity of the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>To explain my self in this matter; The malignity of the times, and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asters ensuing thereupon for above these Forty Years, have been too pernicious to be soon forgot. There are none so Ignorant who have not heard of the Defeat of his late Majesties Army by the Rebels at <hi>Worcester,</hi> on the 3d of <hi>September, 1651.</hi> And of the then Preservation of His Sacred Life and Person by the Care and Fidelity of his Catholic Subjects, of whom I acknowledg my self the most unworthy. In this sad Conjuncture it was, That the desolate King after having been harassed to and fro, Night and Day in continual Fatigues and Perils, from <hi>Wednesday</hi> the Day of the Battle till <hi>Sunday</hi> following (the particulars of which are out of the Sphere of my present design to enlarge upon) at last found an Asylum and Refuge at Mr. <hi>Whitgrave</hi>'s House at <hi>Moseley,</hi> whither Divine Providence, not long before, brought me, and where I had first the Honor of Attending upon him, During this Retreat, whilst Mr. <hi>Whitgrave,</hi> his Lady and Mother, (who alone of all the Houshold were Privy to the Secret) were often busied in watching and other discharges of their Duty towards his Accommodation and Safeguard, His Majesty was pleased to entertain himself for the most part with me in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, by perusing several of my Books, amongst others he took up this present Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise then a Manuscript, lying on the Table of a Closet adjacent to my Chamber. He read it; He seriously considered it, and after mature deliberation pronounced this Sentence upon it, (viz) <hi>I have not seen any thing more Plain and Clear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Subject: The Arguments here drawn from Succession, are so conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, I do not conceive how they can be denyed.</hi> Now that this was not any sudden motion or superficial Complement of his Majesty, but the Product of a Real and Solid Conviction, is manifest by the Tenor and gravity of the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; by the Papers found in his Closet after his Decease under his own hand, which seem even to the very manner of expression to breath the same Spirit and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius with that of the Book: And lastly, by those truly Christian Catholic Resolutions he took (albeit through frailty late) in disposing himself for an happy departure out of this World by an entire Reconcilement to God and the Church. For this Cause I have annexed to the close of this Treatise as well the beforementioned Papers, as also a brief Account of what upon my own knowledg occured at his Death in regard to Religion. If therefore evincing Arguments, confirmed by the final Sentiments and Example of a King known as great in Judgment as Dignity, may through the Influence of Divine Grace, be Prevalent: I have just Reason to hope this little Book will have the same effect upon others as it had upon him.

            <p n="24">24.

Amongst <hi>Schismatics</hi> not fallen to formal He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, but dividing themselves from the Church, (through Pride only and Disobedience,) there may be found the same Ministry of Doctrin and Sacraments with the True Church; yet are not Schismatics according to St. <hi>Aug.</hi>

                     <hi>This, to omit other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, is at large declared by</hi> Willet <hi>Protestant Bishop of</hi> Rochester, <hi>from Scriptures, Fathers, Councils and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the whole Church, in his Sermon preached at</hi> Hampton-Court, Sept. 21. 1606. <hi>when he saith, touching Ordination,</hi> That in the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> there were <hi>Presbyters</hi> long before <hi>Timothy</hi> was appointed Bishop there. Yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> sent him on purpose to impose Hands, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. and for that intent also he left <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Creta, Tit.</hi> 1.5. Neither would the Church of Christ succeeding admit any other but Bishops to that business, as not justifiable for the Presbyter, either by Reason, Example or Scripture; for Reason, it is a Rule without contradiction, <hi>saith the Apostle,</hi> Heb. 7. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>That he which blesseth should be greater then he which is blessed,</hi> (taking it for the Blessing which is by <hi>Authority,</hi> not of Devotion;) The blessing of authority therefore come from the <hi>greater,</hi> as honor is in him that confers it, not in him that takes it, and this is St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his Reason on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. Secondly, for <hi>Example,</hi> not one is shewed through the Ecclesiastical History, that any besides a Bishop did it; if some of the Inferior presumed to do it, his Act was reversed by the Church as unlawful, as in the case of <hi>Colluthus</hi> a Presbyter of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whereof St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> make mention, who took upon him to give Orders, for which both himself was censured and what he did was revoked, and they received as meer Lay-men, and no otherwise, into the Communion, whom he had ordered: For <hi>Scripture,</hi> there is none, neither of holy Men, nor of the Holy Ghost; for all the holy Fathers with one consent do contradict it. <hi>Chrys.</hi> upon 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Theodoret</hi> upon the same places, <hi>Oecumenius</hi> upon 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5 <hi>Ambrose</hi> is peremptory, that it is neither <hi>fas</hi> nor <hi>jus,</hi> consonant neither with God's nor Man's Law, that any besides a Bishop should do it.

            <div type="paper">
               <head>The first Paper.</head>
               <p>THE Discourse we had the other Day, I hope satisfied you in the main, <hi>That Christ can have but one Church here upon Earth;</hi> and I believe that it is as visible, as that the Scripture is in Print, That none can be that Church, but that which is called the <hi>Roman Catholic Church.</hi> I think you need not trouble your self with the entring into that Ocean of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Disputes, when the main, and in truth, the only Question is, Where that Church is, which we profess to believe in the two Creeds? We declare there to believe one Catholic and Apostolic Church, and it is not left to every Phantastical Man's head to believe as he pleases, but to the Church, to whom Christ left the Power upon Earth to govern us in matters of Faith, who made these Creeds for our Directions. It were a very irrational thing to make Laws for a Country, and leave it to the Inhabitants to be the Interpreters and Judges of those Laws: For then every Man will be his own Judge, and by consequence no such thing as either Right or Wrong. Can we therefore suppose that God Almighty would leave us at those Uncertainties, as to give us a Rule to go by, and leave every Man to be his own Judge? I do ask any ingenuous Man, whether it be not the same thing to follow our own P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ancy, or to Interpret the Scripture by it? I would have any Man shew me, where the Power of deciding matters of Faith is given to every particular Man. Christ left his Power to his Church <hi>even to forgive Sins in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and left his Spirit with them, which they exercised after his Resurrection: First by his Apostles in their Creeds, and many
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40980:18"/> Years after by the Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> where that Creed was made that is called by that Name: And by the Power which they had received from Christ, they were the Judges even of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self, many years after the Apostles, which Books were Canonical and which were not. And if they had this Power then, I desire to know how they came to lose it, and by what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Men separate themselves from that Church? The only Pretence I ever heard of, was, because the Church has failed in wrestling and interpreting the Scripture contrary to the true Sense and meaning of it, and that they have imposed Articles of Faith upon us, which are not to be warranted by God's Word. I do desire to know who is to be Judge of that, whether the whole Church, the Succession whereof has continued to this Day without interruption; or particular Men, who have raised Schisms for their own Advantage?</p>

               <p>IT is a sad thing to consider, what a World of <hi>Heresies</hi> are crept into this Nation; every Man thinks himself as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent a Judge of the Scriptures, as the very Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and 'tis no wonder that it should be so, since that part of the Nation which looks most like a Church, dares not bring the true Arguments against the other Sects, for fear they should be turn'd against themselves, and confuted by their own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Church of <hi>England</hi> (as it is call'd) would fain have it thought, They are the Judges in matters Spiritual, and yet dare not say positively there is no Appeal from Them: For ei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther they must say, that They are Infallible (which they canno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap> pretend to) or confess, That what they decide in matters of Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>science, is no farther to be followed than it agrees with every
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40980:18"/> Man's private Judgment. If Christ did leave a Church here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, and we were all once of that Church; How and by what Authority, did we separate from that Church? If the Power of Interpreting of Scripture be in every Man's Brain, what need have We of a Church or Church men? To what purpose then did our Saviour, after he had given his Apostles power to bind and loose in Heaven and Earth, add to it, <hi>That he would be with Them even to the End of the World?</hi> These Words were not spoken Parabolically or by way of Figure: Christ was then A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending into his Glory, and <hi>left his Power with his Church even to the End of the World.</hi> We have had these Hundred years past, the sad effects of denying to the Church that Power in matters Spiritual, without an Appeal. What Country can sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in peace or quiet, where there is not a Supreme Judge, from whence there can be no Appeal? Can there be any Justice done where the Offenders are their own Judges, and equal Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law, with those, who are appointed to administer Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice? This is our case here in <hi>England</hi> in matters Spiritual: For the <hi>Protestants</hi> are not of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as 'tis the true Church from whence there can be no Appeal, but because the Discipline of that Church is conformable at that present to their Phancies, which as soon as it shall contradict or vary from, They are ready to embrace or join with the next Congregation of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whose Discipline or Worship agrees with their own Opinion at that time; so that according to this Doctrin, there is no other Church, nor Interpreter of Scripture, but that which lies in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Mans giddy Brain. I desire to know therefore of every serious Considerer of these things, whether the great Work of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ought to depend upon such a sandy Foundation as this? Did Christ ever say to the Civil Magistrates (much less to the People) <hi>That He would be with Them to the End of the World?</hi> Or did he give Them the Power to forgive Sins? St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians, Ye are Gods Husbandry, Ye are Gods Building, We are Laborers with God,</hi> This shews who are the Laborers, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40980:19"/> who are the Husbandry, and Building? And in this whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in the preceding one, St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes great pains to set forth, that They, <hi>(the Clergy) have the Spirit of God, without which no Man searches the deep things of God.</hi> And he concludes the Chapter with this Verse, <hi>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he might instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</hi> Now if we but consider in human Probability and Reason, the Powers Christ leaves to his Church in the Gospel, and St. <hi>Pau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> explains so distinctly afterwards; we cannot think that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>viour said all these things to no purpose: And pray consider on the other side, that those who Resist the Truth, and will not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his Church, draw their Arguments from Implications, and far fetch'd Interpretations, at the same time that they deny plai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and positive Words; which is so great a Dis-ingenuity, as 'tis not almost to be thought, that they can believe themselves. Is there any other Foundation of the <hi>Protestant Church,</hi> but that, if the Civil Magistrate please, He may call such of the Clergy as he thinks fit for his turn at that time, and turn the Church either to <hi>Presbytery, Independency,</hi> or indeed what he pleases?

            <p>UPon <hi>Thursday</hi> the Fifth of <hi>February,</hi> 1685.

Accordingly I came, and was order'd not to stir from thence till further notice; being thus obliged to wait, and not having had time to bring along with me the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar, I was in some Anxiety how to procure it: In this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture (the Divine Providence so disposing) Father <hi>Bento de Lemos</hi> a <hi>Portugez</hi> came thither, and understanding the circumstance I was in, readily profer'd himself to go to St. <hi>James</hi>'s and bring the Most Holy Sacrament along with him.</p>

The King then declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, That he desired to die in the Faith and Communion of the Holy Roman Catholic Church, That he was most heartily sorry for all the Sins of his life past, and particularly for that he had deferred his Reconciliation so long; That through the Merits of Christ's Passion he hoped for Salvation, That he was in Charity with all the World; that with all his heart he Pardon'd his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and desired Pardon of all those whom he had any wise of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and that if it pleased God to spare him longer Life, he would amend it, detesting all Sin.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:40980:20"/>
            <p>I then advertis'd His Majesty of the benefit and necessity of the Sacrament of Penance, which advertisement the King most willingly embracing, made an exact Confession of his whole Life with exceeding Compunction and Tenderness of Heart, which ended, I desired him, in farther sign of Repentance and true sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for his Sins, to say with me this little short Act of Contrition.</p>
            <p>O my Lord God, with my whole Heart and Soul I detest all the Sins of my Life past for the Love of Thee, whom I love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, and I firmly purpose by thy Holy Grace never to offend thee no more, <hi>Amen</hi> Sweet Jesus. <hi>Amen.</hi> Into thy hands sweet Jesus I commend my Soul, Mercy, sweet Jesus, Mercy. This he pronounced with a clear and audible voice, which done, and his Sacramental Penance admitted, I gave him Absolution.</p>
            <p>After some time thus spent, I asked His Majesty, if he did not also desire to have the other Sacraments of the Holy Church ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred to him? He replyed, by all means, I desire to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of all the helps and succours necessary and expedient for a Catholic Christian in my condition. I added, and doth not your Majesty also desire to Receive the Pretious Body and Blood of our dear Saviour Jesus Christ in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist? His Answer was this: If I am worthy, pray fail not to let me have it. I then told him, it would be brought to him very speedily and desired his Majesty, that in the interim he would give me leave to proceed to the Sacrament of Extreme Unction, he replyed with all my Heart; I then anointed him, which as soon as perform'd I was called to the Door, whither the blessed Sacrament was now brought and delivered to me.</p>
            <p>Then returning to the King, I entreated His Majesty, that he would prepare and dispose himself to receive. At which the King raising up himself, said, let me meet my Heavenly Lord in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter posture than in my Bed. But I humbly begg'd His Majesty to repose himself: God Almighty who saw his Heart would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his good intention. The King then having again reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40980:20"/> the forementioned Act of Contrition with me, he received the Most Holy Sacrament for his Viaticum with all the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of Devotion imaginable. The Communion being ended I Read the usual Prayers, termed the Recommendation of the Soul, appointed by the Church for Catholics in his condition. After which the King desired the Act of Contrition: O my Lord God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be repeated, this done, for his last Spiritual encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement I said.</p>
            <p>Your Majesty hath now received the Comfort and Benefit of all the Sacraments, that a good Christian (ready to depart out of this World) can have or desire. Now it rests only, That you think upon the Death and Passion of our Dear Saviour Jesus Christ of which I present unto you this Figure (shewing him a Crucifix) lift up therefore the Eyes of your Soul and represent to your self your sweet Saviour here Crucified: Bowing down his Head to Kiss you: His Arms stretched out to Embrace you: His Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Members all Bloody and Pale with Death to Redeem you: And as you see him Dead and fixed upon the Cross for your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; So have his Remembrance fixed and fresh in your Heart: beseech him with all Humility, that his most precious Blood may not be shed in vain for you: And that it will please him by the Merits of his bitter Death and Passion to pardon and forgive you all your Offences, and finally to receive your Soul into his blessed Hands, and when it shall please him to take it out of this Transitory World, to grant you a joyful Resurrection and an Eternal Crown of Glory in the next. In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So Recommending His Majesty on my Knees, with all the Transport of Devotion I was able, to the Divine Mercy and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection I withdrew out of the Chamber.</p>
